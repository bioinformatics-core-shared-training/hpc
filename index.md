# Hpc Training.  
### Using the Cambridge Institute&#39;s High Performance Computing Facilites


[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/hpc).   


## This brief course will give you three things

1. A refresher on Unix and an introduction to cluster computing
2. Basic instruction on using our scheduler
3. Some performance hints

It won't make you an expert on parallel computing and H.P.C, but will let you get to work.

We also have a practical session (on Sections I & II). You are welcome to look at this too, but bear in mind that you will 
need an account with the CRUK Cambridge Institute for the commands to work.
